Another year. Another flood of new years resolutions. 
A new year for hopes, dreams & promises.

This year I'd like to try something different. Rather making new resolutions, I'd  like to first be grateful for what I am and second do more of what I've been doing best.

To start something new it needs effort and a solid intention. To sustain it for a long time, it needs to have a meaning or purpose behind it. Starting a fad diet or new habit works for the short run if the intention behind it is to look good for others. When the intention is to feel good by being healthy, then something changes. Now this resolution is sustainable throughout our waking lives.

For this shift in paradigm, understanding the source, of the urge to change is important. If that comes from a positive space then that comes from stability, no matter how much we evolve or devolve. 

So here is to a new year. Let us forgive ourselves for the resolutions we couldn't keep and cherish the lessons we learnt along the way.
Happy New Year!
