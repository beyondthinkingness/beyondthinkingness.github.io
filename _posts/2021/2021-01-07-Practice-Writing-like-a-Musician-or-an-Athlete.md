Knowledge workers aren't known to pursue virtuosity in their fundamental skills. The best Athletes and Musicians deliberately practice on honing their foundational skills.

They rigorously work with coaches and go through hours of performance videos. They religiously work on improving critical skills by drilling.

Knowledge workers need to hone their skills like reading, note-taking and developing ideas over time. 

Knowledge workers to expect to improve their skills with each project. They feel that it will push them beyond their past skill threshold. They miss out that their effort is focused on the project rather than building skills.

This brings us to a crossroad because, such skills aren't clearly defined and techniques for improving aren't fully recognized.
But, some systems like evergreen notes (e.g. Zettlekasten) and spaced repetition (e.g.) Anki, are promising.
