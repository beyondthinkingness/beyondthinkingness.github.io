Have you ever felt stuck in life l, a job or a mood? Do you find yourself going through the same motions daily with no perspective. I did and sometimes still dom

But what helps me is setting clear and honest intentions. I simply ask myself "How do I want to live my life today?" Usually the answer is: I want to want to be happy, peacefull and have clarity today. I am not concerned with a failing project or a bad day, and I won't let them dictate my happiness. 
The feeling that follows is great. What helps setting this intention is will power to see through it.

Writing down these intention in my journal or a sticky note, makes me always come back to it as a reminder.
The more the brain is trained this way, the more the mind comes out of the auto-pilot mode of going through the motions.

Another question which works is "Who do I want to be today?"
If I am going to play a role, I'd rather play the role of the person full with clarity, peace and happiness.
